# Goal: Practice using 'in' with strings.
# Expected outcome:
# - Prints exactly:
#   True
#   False

word = "python"

# TODO: Replace None with membership checks using 'in'
print("python" in word)  # should be True because 'py' is in "python"
print("cyborg" in word)  # should be False because 'java' is not in "python"
