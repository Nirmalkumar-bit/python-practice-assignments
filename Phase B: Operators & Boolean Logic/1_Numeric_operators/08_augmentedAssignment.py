# Goal: Use augmented assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, //=, %=).
# Expected outcome: When run, the program prints exactly:
# Score: 42

score = 10

# TODO:
# 1) add 15 to score using +=
# 2) multiply score by 2 using *=
# 3) subtract 3 using -=
# After these steps, score should be 42.

# score ???
score+=15
score*=2
score-=8
